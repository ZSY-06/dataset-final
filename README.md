Project idea (overview)
My project is about how people can use or destroy nature for the sake of technological advancement and take it for themselves. Start new research and projects. I will make a video based on the generated AI images to show people's control and destruction of nature.

Brief conceptual reflection ( minimum 250 words) 
For this assignment, I feel more familiar with how to operate the code to create the pictures I want to present, and it also makes me have a different idea about my project. The video I showed tells the story of people's selfishness and greed. People will destroy a vibrant place and then change it to what they want. It is this action and their ideas that bring them disasters, but now there is another idea in my mind that when people first discovered this deep forest, they still wanted to study the unknown, but they did it in a way to protect the forest, helping the scarce plants in the forest to reproduce and become everywhere. In this way, people will not only get the resources they want, but also expand the forest better. This new idea is exactly the opposite of what I implemented. This idea also made me realize that people put interests first and then conscience. This project is inseparable from the existence of the word technology. Technology is what people in this project desire, imagine, and study, and it is also what creates this project. Everyone has different technologies. Some people can use technology to lead people to convenience and comfort, while others can use technology to lead people to despair and death. Back to the beginning of the class, technology and art are connected, and I think this is also the meaning of this class because this class has been using technology to create art, and art is all around us.
